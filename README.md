Project contains generators for [one time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) based on the time and on a counter. Code is written in [Swift4](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and depends on the CommonCrypto module. At this moment, CommonCrypto is not a modular framework and all of it's headers have been compiled into this library. Unfortunatelly it's the only way to make it work for the time being.

### Installation

```

#### Carthage

Add the following line to your Cartfile:
```
github "codewise/ios-otp-generators" ~> 1.0
```
Then in files where you need to use it just add:
